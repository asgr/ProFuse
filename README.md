# ProFuse
ProFound + ProFit + ProSpect = ProFuse

This is the spectral spatial decomposition package as discussed in Robotham+ 2022. This work was carried out in close collaboration with Sabien Bellstedt.

Below is an example GAMA RGB (Hig) colour image:

Which we then decompose the ProFuse, creating the following 9 band spectral spatial decomposition:

The key part here is that we now get separate star formation histories (SFHs) for our bulge and disk component, which when combined can be multi-modal, and much more complex than allowed with a unimodal ProSpect SFH.
